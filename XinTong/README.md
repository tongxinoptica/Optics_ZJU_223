# TWC-Swin

The code is avaliable for the paper [Harnessing the magic of light: spatial coherence instructed swin transformer for universal holographic imaging. Advanced Photonics, 2023, 5(6): 066003.(https://doi.org/10.1117/1.AP.5.6.066003)] 

1.Download and unzip swin.zip

2.Run the Sample_prediciton.py

3.Change the parameter 'coherence' to view the output results under different spatial coherence


Note that the basic environmental requirements: Python 3.8.1, Pytorch 1.9.0
